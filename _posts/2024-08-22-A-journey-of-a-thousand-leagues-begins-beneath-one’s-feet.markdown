If only to understand the traces of old memory for the curious. This you have stated, and these are your words. Can the same day occur more frequently than once? Whether a flask exists or not, who would not be justly mocked if it were of no use? Indeed, I wish for there to be as much power in virtue as possible; we see that cattle use horns, worms crawl, ducks swim, blackbirds fly, and bees sting. I will compare with you how each thing will come into play. If long, whether a light flask is or not, either everything or parts in a very abundant and greatest variety.

Indeed, Homer seems to have seen something of this kind in those things he has invented about the songs of the Sirens.

For it is not possible to discuss without criticism, nor can one discuss rightly with anger or obstinacy. Whether the offspring of a slave woman should be considered among the fruits will be debated among the leaders of the city. Consider in geometry, if you give the first, all must be given. For it is lengthy to respond to everything.
